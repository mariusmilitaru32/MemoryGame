I built this memory card game as a fun and interactive way to challenge the mind and improve memory skills. The concept of the game is simple yet engaging, making it a great pastime for people of all ages. This project allowed me to apply and showcase my skills in JavaScript, HTML, and CSS. It was a great opportunity for me to experiment with different techniques and libraries, and to learn more about Javascript and user experience design.
